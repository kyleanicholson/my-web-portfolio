				<code>Hello world</code> and welcome! 
			</h2>
			<p> 
				I am building this website from the ground up as a personal challenge to make me a better programmer. The site will start off simple and static, but over time it will grow in complexity as I learn new skills, add features and create project showcases. I believe this is the best way for me to learn and improve my skills as a programmer because it allows me the flexibility to work on things that are meaningful to me without the constraints of tutorials and more structured assignments. I hope that anyone reading this will find value here and be inspired to try this themselves!
			</p>
			<h3>Who am I? </h3>
			<p>
				I am an IT application architect with 8 years of experience working in the healthcare IT space. I specialize in application support and integration for small outpatient units and specialty clinics. I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in public health. Outside of learning some SAS statistical analysis during my thesis, I have no formal training in programming. For now, I am choosing to remain anonymous, although I am happy to receive contact via my <a href=#>contact page </a> if you would like to connect.
			</p>
			<h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>
			<p>
				I have thought about this question extensively, and the truth is I want to build a better career. IT has never fulfilled me or allowed me the freedom to build things the way I want them to be. In every IT job I've had, I've been beholden to supporting software that I have no direct control over. This means that if a client has a problem, I'm constrained in my ability to solve that problem by the limitations of the software. I believe learning programming will help me move past those limitations and learn how fix the problem at the source as opposed to managing symptoms and making apologies.  
			</p>
			<p>
				I've had a number of false starts when attempting to learn programming in the past. I have tended to focus too much on what I thought was the end game of being a programmer: a six figure salary, stock options, great benefits and the potential to work on the cutting edge of technology. The process of learning to code was never enjoyable to me because I saw it as more of a means to an end -- a chore that involved repeating the same practice exercises over and over until someone offered me that dream job.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have learned the hard way that no one becomes a successful programmer without developing some passion for the process of coding. In this way, it's the same as any other skill that takes time to develop and master. The amount of time it takes to get good at it simply doesn't lend itself to short term thinking. If you can't learn to love the process there's a good chance you will quit when things start to get difficult.
